# ProgLogLessons
Programmable logic lessons - how to do formal verification, trying different designs for FSMs (e.g. combinatorial with the sync block that only assigns states vs. the kind I do now which are all synchronous), etc.

# purpose
I am learning programmable logic and there are a number of basics to master. At some point this repo and its wiki may be useful to other people. I'm making it public so anyone who's interested in my programmable logic process and capabilities can see what I've been through.
